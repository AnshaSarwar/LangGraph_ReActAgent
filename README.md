# LangGraph ReAct Agent with Groq LLaMA3

This is a simple ReAct agent using Groq's 'llama3-70b-8192' model powered via the **LangGraph** framework. It showcases how to bind tools such as 'add', 'multiply, and 'divide' to help understand how a ReAct agent works.
The agent supports synchronous and asynchronous streaming execution, showing how an LLM can break down and solve multi-step tasks by calling tools.
